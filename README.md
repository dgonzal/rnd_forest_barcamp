# sportalliance_rnd_forest_barcamp
Repository with all needed to run the barcamp.
What are we going to do during the workshop?

- install python 
- install jupyter notebook
- install libraries & import them
  - pandas & scikit learn
- download data from kaggle
- first look at data from kaggle 
- train a decision tree 
- train a random forest 
- last word on performance

This repository will consist of a jupyternootebook file which contains the documentation of what
we will be looking at and all python code needed. 

The installation can be either done through homebrew or through anaconda and data from kaggle will be used. 
Since anaconda is a GUI Tool no further documentation will be given. For homebrew the following commands need to be run 
in a terminal

- Install homebrew on your machine
```console
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

- Install python 
```console
$ brew install python
```

- Install jupyter
```console 
$ brew install jupyter
```

from here on everything else will be done in the jupyter notebook.
